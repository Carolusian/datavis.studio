## T&L Review

### Future wishlist

Those items were not covered due to average pacing but good to incorporate in the future:

* D3 - data driven visualisation -- operate DOM object in a batch
* G2 - grammar of graphics -- learn how to abstract a complex problem
* Google Analytics - User behaviour tracking & analysis

### Open source learning

CILO2 and part of CILO1 are shifted to online platforms like GitHub, Slack, and DNN Newsletter. We encourage the students to adapt to this open source/ objective-driven learning model. This initiative is sponsored by HKBU/CHTL/TDG-1.

### Service learning components

The theme of this semester is "reporting and visualising for the underprivileged". The "mentorship" resource in CILO4 is addressed partly by this component (some students found their own collaborating parties). This initiative is sponsored by HKBU/CISL mini-grant.
